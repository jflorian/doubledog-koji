# The following entries will be included in the repository composition
# produced by the mash-everything script.  The format is as follows:
#   - One entry per line.
#   - Each entry consists of two fields, separated by a colon (":").
#   - The first field is the mash configuration name.
#   - The second field is the name of the directory into which that repository
#     will be composited, relative to REPO_DIR (see
#     /etc/koji-helpers/mash-everything.conf).
#   - Lines beginning with any amount of whitespace and hash ("#") are treated
#     as comments and ignored.
