# The follow options were gleaned from get_options() in /usr/sbin/kojid.
# There is no documentation for these and perhaps no promise of future
# support.  However, get_options() does seem to fail for any unknown option.
# Any documentation given here was learned the hard way through
# experimentation and analyses of the source.
