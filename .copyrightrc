# 'update' is a Python list of files and/or directories to be updated.
# Directories will be recursed into, but symlinks will not be followed.
update: ['./']

# 'exclude' is a Python list of file- and directory- base-names to be
# excluded.  Names without a trailing slash (e.g., 'foo') exclude files and
# directories.  Names with a trailing slash (e.g., 'foo/') exclude only
# directories.  This file is implicitly excluded.
exclude: ['.git/']

# 'pattern' is an extended regular expression that must be found within a text
# line for that line to be considered appropriate for a copyright update.
# Once a line has been selected for update, this regex is ignored as the
# program then merely looks for dates to be revised within that line.  If more
# than one date appears, the first (initial copyright) is retained and the
# last (most recent copyright) is updated.  Any intermediate dates are
# eliminated as the result is just a simple range or single value if the range
# would consist of only one date.
pattern: copyright.*Florian
